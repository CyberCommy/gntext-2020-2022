Babysat Unawareby S_P_R[http://giantessworld.net/viewstory.php?sid=6676](http://giantessworld.net/viewstory.php?sid=6676)复习的闲暇时间抽空找了一篇比较喜欢而且简单的文章翻译，中间有些couple段落可能会发在极限区，也可能直接跳过涉及内容：scat  crush  unaware  mouth play以下正文：保姆

詹姆斯简直不敢相信。做一个保姆？在星期五？这就是在浪费他的时间。他坐在家里的客厅里面看着他的婴儿妹妹，玛丽，在玩着一个玩偶，时不时地咬在上面来缓解出牙期的疼痛。她才一岁半，而且已经可以在屋子里面爬来爬去了。在旁边的屋子里，玛丽的姐姐玛丽莎在玩手机，詹姆斯能够频繁的听到消息提醒。他不能理解为什么他七岁的妹妹能够有这么多消息。就在他考虑这些事情的时候，他的妈妈走了进来给了他最后通牒。“给玛丽换衣服然后哄她睡觉，别让玛丽莎做这个。不要叫你的朋友过来玩，你今晚要专心照顾你的妹妹，知道了？”詹姆斯清楚地知道他的朋友已经再来的路上了。“知道。”他的母亲很满意：“还有用其他问题吗？”詹姆斯忍不住问：“萨拉基本和我同岁为什么不让她来做这个？”他的妹妹萨拉在楼上，准备着今晚出去到镇上和朋友玩，她比詹姆斯小了不到一岁，也是18岁，所以他只不过是为今晚他将成为保姆的事实感到烦闷罢了。他已经在母亲回答他之前就已经知道答案了。“理论上你是最大的应该承担更多的责任，好了，我要出门了，爱你呦我的甜心。”詹姆斯看着他的母亲从前门走出去。他将自己瘫在沙发上，掏出手机给他的朋友们发消息，抱怨他现在有多么的无聊。在经历了漫长的等待后，他的朋友终于到了。他给他的小团体打开了门。“嘿！过的怎么样？”罗布边说边走进了屋子。罗布是这个团体里面和詹姆斯最亲近的，然后是西蒙，罗布的铁哥们，还有两个女生。贝卡是典型的拉拉队长类型，声音很大，有点笨，身材高大。詹姆斯很想和她交往，但他只能做到用他那拙劣的笑话引来几声轻笑。最后一个进来的是凯莉。她很安静，尤其是比起团体里面的其他人，但她是相当时髦的而且很了解罗布，所以经常能够看到她自己跟着罗布。“我们在你家的门口发现了这个包裹…”西蒙说着递给詹姆斯一个棕色的盒子。奇怪的是上面的名字是詹姆斯而不是他的父母。“我不记得我订购任何东西。”几个人走进厨房围坐在坐子旁。每一个人都很好奇詹姆斯手中的到底是什么，尤其是詹姆斯自己也不知道。他撕开了外包装拿出了一小片金属，他看起来像是某个器械的一部分。不锈钢质地以及奇怪的形状。当詹姆斯拿起它的时候一道突然出现的闪光让桌子边的每一个人都看不见了。接着他们便失去了意识。——当詹姆斯醒过来的时候一时间还不能理解发生了什么。他在一个非常光滑的平面上，远处罗布和贝卡在跑向他。他站起来环顾四周，他身边的椅子十分巨大，一直延伸到天空。厨房的灯如同阳光一样耀眼。罗布和贝卡最后跑到了他的身边。“发生了什么？”詹姆斯问。罗布回答说：“我们现在已经和虫子一样大了。”

Meeting the Baby by S_P_RIn their new world it was unclear what exactly the group should do next.在这个新世界里面他们不清楚应该做什么正文：碰见婴儿“我们还应该去找到凯莉和西蒙。”罗布建议。“对，先去找到他们。”詹姆斯同意。团队开始在瓷砖地面上面穿行。在这个环境里有着远处传来的隆隆声，还有着大量的家具，寻找他人如同大海捞针一般。詹姆斯到现在依然不能够相信到底发生了什么。以他现在的尺寸整个房间都开始变得巨大而怪异。在来到詹姆斯家客厅的毛地毯上面之后，罗布看见了其他人躲在房间中央的玻璃咖啡桌下面。罗布，詹姆斯和贝卡缓慢而坚定的穿过遍布玩具和布偶的地面来到了房间中央。“哦，感谢上帝你还活着。”贝卡高兴的冲过去抱住了凯莉。“到底发生了什么？我们要怎样才能变回正常大小？”西蒙问道。在其他人能够回答之前，地面剧烈的震动起来。所有人疑惑地看向四周，詹姆斯十分慌乱，担心他们是否会被再一次缩小。但是过了一会周围平静了下来，什么也没有发生。穿过房间来到虫子大小的团体的高耸物体是玛丽。这个蹒跚学步的孩子在自己一个人和玩偶玩得高兴。“天啊！她是个巨人！”贝卡尖叫着。“不，只是我们变小了。”詹姆斯吃惊的回应道。直到现在詹姆斯才意识到这个透明咖啡桌的位置有多么糟糕。玛丽开始向着桌子爬来然后注意到了聚集在桌子下面的一群小人。詹姆斯在观察到婴儿的眼睛开始注意这里并突然睁大的时候感觉如坠冰窟。在婴儿开始靠近的时候没有任何人敢动一下。曾经可爱的婴儿现在如同一座大山般伫立在他们面前，粉色的衬衣和尿布在人们上方几百英尺的地方晃动。玛丽对于这群小人十分感兴趣，她从未见过这种东西，她那正在发育的大脑极度渴望能够和这些新玩具玩耍。她尝试着钻到桌子下面，但是缺乏协调性的胳膊和身体使的这变得十分困难。最后，贝卡被恐惧占据了身体，尖叫着跑向了安全的沙发下面。詹姆斯喊着让她停下可是她已经跑出了桌子。团队里面的人都看见了玛丽看向了奔跑中的小人找到了得到新玩具的机会。贝卡尽可能的跑快一些，但是这些年的拉拉队训练并不能让她跑赢一个泰坦般的巨人。她回头的瞬间看到了胖乎乎的小手满怀恶意的抓向了她。她尖叫着被毫不犹豫地紧紧抓在了手里。詹姆斯曾经看到玛丽是怎样进行玩耍的，她粗暴，用力，以及恶毒。在贝卡被婴儿抓在手里的时候，詹姆斯就知道她难逃一死了。

Canned“罐头”贝卡艰难的将头从玛丽巨大的手掌中吧拔出，她已经完全悬在了空中，感受到风吹过她的头发，视线划过玛丽胖乎乎的小脚，膝盖，然后是比她大无数倍的印着卡通形象的尿布。接着是玛丽的肚子，带有更多巨大的卡通图案和许多口水的污点的粉色衬衣，来到了玛丽满是期待的脸前。在那一瞬间贝卡和凯莉的目光碰在了一起。贝卡看到了如同广告牌一样巨大的脸，同时婴儿的大眼睛也在观察着小人。玛丽现在非常好奇。贝卡能够感受到小女孩那充满着婴儿食品以及呕吐物的吐息吹在她脸上。玛丽非常激动，她刚刚找到了一个非常奇怪的虫子。当她看着它时会感到一阵兴奋，完全不去想为什么她会感到兴奋。在捏碎它之前，她听到了一个有趣的声音，就像她以前的某些玩具一样，她很喜欢这个。团体的其他人在下面看着，静止不动以免像啦啦队长一样被抓住。贝卡发出了一声尖叫，尝试着叫喊可惜婴儿控制了她的呼吸。玛丽觉得它的挣扎很有趣并咯咯笑着。震耳欲聋的声音让贝卡觉得自己要聋了，她希望能停下，无论是笑声还是挤压，这所有的一切都停下。玛丽开心的打开了她的嘴，将贝卡送向那里。贝卡恢复了呼吸尖叫着被送向了那巨大的洞口。这不是她想要的死亡，被一个学步的孩子吞下后消化处理最终被排泄在五颜六色的尿布上。当她在靠近巨大的流淌着口水的口腔时她祈祷着孩子能够挺懂她的叫喊。不幸的是玛丽并没有听从她的祈祷而是高兴的将她扔进了嘴里。出乎贝卡的意料，玛丽并没有马上将她咽下去，当她的头被扔进了口中的时候她的双脚被玛丽的嘴唇夹住了。玛丽收紧了她的嘴唇，调整虫子的位置，在她看来这种虫子的味道尝起来非常好。加上它们跑过自己的肚子是痒痒的很有趣，婴儿想到的第一件事就是近可能的品尝它。“哦天哪，她把她当成了乳头用了！”西蒙在下面评论着。他是对的，玛丽用她的舌头将女孩的头顶在了上颚上并开始允吸她。味道尝起来还可以，于是她接着允吸着并去玩她其他的玩具了。对于贝卡来说，一切比刚才更加糟糕了，她只来得及短短的吸了一口气就感到所有的血液都涌上头部。在呼吸的是后她希望玛丽能够停下，但是没用的。玛丽的口水覆盖了贝卡，在她喘息的时候进入了她的嘴里。在不停的允吸中所有的血液都涌上头部。玛丽开始在周围玩耍了，在她开始穿着尿布走动的时候很难将注意力再集中在嘴里面的小虫子上。她很享受小虫子的律动。每次她用力的将虫子顶在上面都能够感受的其更用力的蠕动，这样就能更好的品尝了。团队里的人在下面满怀敬畏的看着，他们看着他们的朋友的腿在婴儿的嘴唇间拼命的挣扎着。就这样持续了几分钟，但是贝卡已经要见到死神了，她成功地捡回一条命因为小女孩突然打开了嘴让她顺着嘴唇滑落，和一团黏糊糊的口水一起滴在了粉色衬衣上，贝卡剧烈的咳嗽着，让团队里的人很安慰。“她还活着！”詹姆斯向团队里的其他人宣告。“我们怎么去救她呢？”凯莉问道。就在团队思考如何攀爬婴儿身体的时候地面开始了震动。这次不是玛丽造成的了，他仍然站在那里。詹姆斯看着巨大的脚踏进了房间。他的眼睛跟着向上，划过穿着紧身裤的大腿和紫色的背心，看到了不想看到的人，玛丽莎，他七岁的妹妹。“詹姆斯去哪里了？”她问玛丽，也没有期待一个婴儿能有什么回答。其他人震惊的看着玛丽莎走向了玛丽。如果将玛丽比作巨人的话玛丽莎就是泰坦，仅仅是她脚的高度就已经是小人们的好多倍。贝卡眼看着这一切的发生，口水已经干了并将她粘在了衬衣上。被当成奶头使用的她应景无法依靠自己的力量从上面挣脱出来。玛丽莎感到很无聊。她刚刚给她的朋友们发了消息看有没有人能过来，可惜的是大部分人现在连手机都没有。于是她过来陪玛丽一起玩一会消磨时间。她走到玛丽眼前注意到有什么东西在婴儿的衬衣上。“哦？”玛丽莎注意到了那个女孩。贝卡放松下来了。终于有除了婴儿以外的人注意到她了。她终于从折磨中存活了下来，就像是聚会上讲的故事一样。玛丽莎很疑惑她发现的是什么。它看起来不像是食物，也不是小玩具或其他部件，她伸出手将女孩从衬衣上摘下来并拿起。“虫子？”贝卡有一次发出喊叫，这一次是尝试着使一个七岁地女孩相信她不是一个虫子，但是玛丽莎并没有仔细的去听。她仅仅是在考虑如何处理她新发现的虫子。她的母亲总是提醒她如果她被房间里的虫子攻击了会发生很大的麻烦，所以她需要尽快处理掉。然后她有了一个想法。贝卡看着她给婴儿翻了个身，拉开了婴儿后面尿布的松紧带。“哦，上帝！停下！我不是虫子！”贝卡更大声的乞求，可是她的注定会掉进尿布。玛丽莎从来没有听到过虫子能够发出这种声音，如此剧烈的蠕动，尤其是当她玩笑般的要将其扔进尿布里面的时候。她知道这是有原因的，她预想到接下来这只虫子将经历什么，想到处理了一只令人讨厌的虫子就会令她感到开心。最后，她想这是那只讨厌的虫子罪有应得。她对自己的想法漏出了笑容，用两只手指夹住虫子，让贝卡的迎接命运的抉择。就在一瞬间她松手了，贝卡掉了下去。贝卡立刻发出了撕心裂肺的尖叫直到她坠落在一个一岁婴儿的尿布衬垫上。玛丽莎放开了拉着松紧带的手使其再一次彻底裹住了婴儿的屁股，将所有的一切如同设计好的一样封在里面。贝卡陷入了一片黑暗。另一边的玛丽莎的心情已经从刚刚的信心满满变得紧张起来。如果詹姆斯回来之后检查了婴儿的尿布怎么办？玛丽莎确信她会陷入麻烦。得想个法子让他彻底发现不了。另一边团体里的人惊恐地看着这一切的发生。没人愿意相信刚刚发生了什么，这些也有可能会发生在他们的身上，被俩个孩子捕获并杀死。他们看着玛丽莎双膝跪下并将手放在了玛丽的肚子上。团队里的其他人不知道玛丽莎要做什么，但是詹姆斯很清楚。“她在试着让玛丽使用尿布。”玛丽莎按摩着婴儿的腹部，引导她使用她的尿布并消灭虫子。婴儿嘟囔着蹲在了地上并宣布：“poopie！”贝卡并没能听清刚刚婴儿宣布了什么。她突然滑到了尿布形成的黑暗山谷的底端，拥有了很大的空间。她希望是有人会打开尿布并将她解救出来，但是她错的离谱。如果她能够看到她上面是什么她就会知道要发生什么了。婴儿的肚子发出咕噜声然后一瞬间，尿布里充满了沼泽般的“淤泥”和“木条”覆盖了小小的啦啦队长。贝卡几乎不能呼吸，她拼尽全力和冲击她的水流搏斗。尖叫完全无用，她将成为今晚第一个淹死在这浓稠的液体中。其他人惊恐这看着，尿布下垂并立刻将味道传到了他们的鼻子里。玛丽莎很兴奋，问题解决了。婴儿完成排泄并站了起来，她的尿布仍然明显的下垂着。“她死了。”詹姆斯震惊的宣布，看着玛丽莎将玛丽举到了桌子上想要彻底解决这只虫子。他没有完全说对，在尿布里面，在经过多次处理的婴儿食物中，贝卡仍然在粪便与尿液之中。再一次被囚禁在了逐渐凝固的粪便之中，封住了一切却将她的头漏了出来。玛丽莎把玛丽放在桌上，拉开尿布。“真恶心。”玛丽嘟囔着。这一次贝卡不再天真了，救赎不在这里，她没救了，她清楚地知道自己难逃一死了。玛丽莎低头看见了任然在尿布里面挣扎的虫子。起先小女孩还怀疑一只虫子为什么有这么强的生命力，但接下来她清楚她应该弄死这只虫子。玛丽莎高兴地将尿布用双手拿起并团起来，她确保那只虫子在那里被紧紧的夹住，然后她用尽所有的力气挤压已经浸湿的外部直到她听到了一声“POP”在尿布之中后将其扔掉了。贝卡尖叫着当尿布紧紧的包裹了她，所有的空间开始一点点的压缩的时候啦啦队长持续的尖叫。直到她被一个七岁的小女孩从头到脚包裹在粪便中压实。她尝试着尖叫但是粪便进入了她的喉咙，巨大的压力将其挤进了她的耳朵，眼睛，鼻子和嘴里。然后继续。她希望这一切都能结束。不到半秒之后，这位活力四射的啦啦队长变成了一团血浆包裹在一个粉色的脏尿布里扔进了垃圾桶。玛丽莎打开了一个新的尿布给玛丽换上，让玛丽坐了下来。“别再碰那个虫子了！”她又咯咯的笑了起来。“现在怎么办？”西蒙问。

先把剩下的文章放上来吧最近有几科考试要过，会忙一些没有时间有志向的同好可以接着翻译A Plan by S_P_RThe house was quiet, Mary was quietly playing in a fresh diaper. Marissa, having dealt with a minor bug problem, was relaxing on her phone at the kitchen table. Sara and her friends were upstairs getting ready for a night on the town.Meanwhile, huddled under the couch, Jimmy, Rob, Simon, and Kelly huddled in relative darkness, having just witnessed Becca squeezed, sucked on, spit out, and then crushed into nothing in a dirty diaper. The mood was somewhere between solemn and hysterical.Simon had become hopeless, absolutely assured that he would end up crushed under a shoe or like his cheerleader friend, a diaper."What are we even doing? We have no chance. We don't even know how this happened." He argued. Kelly, on the other hand, was determined to avoid such a fate."Okay look we just need to find that metal thing""That metal thing?" Simon said skeptically "We don't even know where that is. It's probably up on the table or something. We're dead.""Hold on" James interjected, "We can just get Sara to get it""You mean your sister. Your giant sister. Who's basically a building to us? That sister?" Simon rebutted, clearly irritated."Yeah" James responded, ignoring the sarcasm. He knew it was a stretch, Sara wasn't exactly fond of bugs either. But what other options were there? At least she probably won't torture them like Marissa would. Giving an entitled 7 year old that kind of power was a mistake."So what's your plan, superman?" Kelly asked."Well, okay, first we need to get somewhere where we can be seen once she comes downstairs, like the kitchen table." James outlined how they would do it "First we climb up the rut on one of the legs, then once we're on the table we hide out under the rim of some plates, and once she comes down we give it a shot. She can't miss us.""You're assuming she doesn't take out a fly swatter and squish us." Rob added."Do you have a better idea? No? Great. Lets give this a shot." James began to lead them out from under the couch. The group was not quick to forget the giant baby in the room. She could catch up to them in seconds, so they hugged the rim of the wall, slowly making their way towards the tile of the kitchen. The process was incredibly slow, the carpet was dense and made for feet, not minuscule people. All the while there were distant sounds of laughing from upstairs, intimidating but at the same time the group took comfort in knowing that their might be a way out of this.After a while they arrived at the tile. Back in the kitchen with its distant light fixtures and tall wood furniture. The team saw that Marissa was now sitting on the counter playing on her phone, her legs dangling down before them."As quiet as possible" James motioned the group move quietly under her feet, the entire time knowing if the little girl decided to jump down, they would be crushed instantly. The scent of her dirty feet drifted down upon them as they did their best to stay entirely quiet. To their surprise, they made it to the table. In theory, the climb seemed simple, but when faced with the reality of how high it went, James became more nervous. He didn't give it away though, the entire group needed confidence to get this to happen, especially him.He lead the way, using tiny breaks in the old wooden table legs to hoist himself up. One at a time they began to scale the table. Inch by inch they made their way up. Finally, after what felt like hours but must've been minutes, James reached the top and lifted himself over the edge. He got his first chance to look back down, below him Kelly was only a few feet down, while Rob was close behind her. But Simon, Simon was significantly farther down. As James lifted Kelly and then Rob over the edge, he heard Simon start yelling."I'm not going to make it! I can't hold on!" He yelled as he lost his footing. As he hung by a single arm, he began to scream.The other three sat at the top, looking down upon him. "Don't yell back" James advised "I don't want to get her atten--"As he said that Marissa's head looked up from her phone, a small miracle considering her obsession with it."Another one?"Back to indexBurned by S_P_RSimon knew he was never the most physically fit, but he hadn't expected to lose his footing like that. It felt like forever as he fell through the air screaming. He had fully anticipated splattering into a million pieces upon hitting the hard wood flooring, but instead he belly flopped and slid a few inches. The pain coming from his chest indicated that he may have broken a few ribs. As he gasped for breath and managed to lift himself onto his hands and knees he felt the floor shift suddenly, knocking him back on his chest and setting off a new round of pain throughout him.Marissa, on the other hand, felt pretty good. She had just beat another level of a game on her phone when she heard a tiny high-pitched sound from across the kitchen. At first she was completely confused, was something broken? She considered going upstairs and getting Sara, but then she found the source, something had fallen off of the table and onto the floor. A bug."Another one?" she questioned aloud, wondering why there were so many of them in the house today. She scooted off the counter, landing with a loud thud that rattled the pots and pans of the kitchen and stepped toward the tiny insect that had invaded her kitchen.Simon had just barely made it to his hands and knees when a shroud of darkness enveloped him, he got goosebumps as he slowly liften his head to see the building-sized silouette of a second-grader staring down at him. His instinct was to run, but he could barely limp as the giant stared down at him.Marissa watched as the bug moved slowly away from her, she smiled. This one's gonna be easy, she thought as she knelt down next to the tiny bug. She slowly curled her pointer-finger to meet with her thumb and shifted her hand down to be right next to the bug, then, she flicked.Simon was trying the best he could. He felt a rush of wind as the giants face suddenly loomed directly over him. All he could think about was Becca living her last moments in a diaper, he knew it was too late for him, but he kept limping anyway. At this moment, Simon made the mistake of glancing behind him, to his horror and confusion a giant fingernail was slowly being lowered toward him. As he realized what was happening, it shot at him, hitting him flat in the back and sending his tiny body clear across the room. Simon instictually screamed at the pain of feeling his back obliterated by the giant nail. He slammed into the stainless steel oven and fell for the second him onto his ribs, which by this point were effectively a liquid. He wanted to scream again, but he could not spare the breath as blood leaked from his chest and back.Marissa was throughly impressed with her work. The bug flew across the room instantly and landed flat on the floor after hitting the oven. There was a little red splotch on the oven, but her mom probably wouldn't notice anyway. Marissa approached the bug once again, and to her surpise it was still squirming in its own fluid."How are you still alive?" she questioned aloud. Then she had an idea, opening the cabinet next to her, she dug through it until she found what she was looking for. Her mom had used this bottle to get rid of other bugs, so it could probably help her finally get rid of this bug. She aimed the bottle down at the buggy and sprayed.Simon tried to move but the pain was too great. He could only motion his arms as he saw the giantess pull out a can of raid. He stared into the nozzle as she put it an inch away from him and pressed it down. Within an instant he was drowning in an olympic swimming pools worth of chemicals. In the first second, his only goal was to keep his head above the waterline, but then the burning took over. He inhaled the chemical and immediatly felt his internal organs liquify, bubbling and burning through him as if he was somehow drowning and on fire at the same time. Simon felt the most excrusitating pain as his muscles seized and his entire body begin to liquidy, all the while being completely consious of the process. As he took his final breaths, a giant finger decended from above and poked him, giving him one last short burst of pain before he disintegrated.Marissa held down the top of the can for a long time, more than her mom did for sure. The buggy was now swimming in the water that came out of the can. Marissa smiled as the bug bubbled like soda, she heard all sorts of funny sounds as the water puddle turned a little red. Out of pure curiousity, she poked the bug with her finger and saw it fall into a bunch of little sizzling pieces. She smiled again at a job well done. She happily stood up and got a paper towel, which soaked up the water and left nothing behind. She took her phone back out and went back into the living room.Back to indexGoing Out by S_P_RJames, Kelly, and Rob sat in despair. Simon was gone, first flicked, then sprayed, then crushed by the giant 7 year old. They could only watch as she casually stood up, mischievous smile across her face, picked up a pear, and walked into the other room."We're all going to die. That's it. We're screwed guys." Rob objectedJames knew that he was more than likely correct. Two of their closest friends had been mercilessly murdered by a baby and a kid. His own siblings. But they had already made it that far.."No. We need to find that steel...thing" but on the table where they sat just an hour before there was nothing. James used the leverage to peer around the room. Where was it? It had to be somewhere.  Did the baby take it? Marissa?"Maybe we just wait until they're all asleep" Kelly proposed, peering into the next room where Marissa toyed with the baby.James shot it down quickly, "I was the one who was supposed to put them to bed" he countered, "so if I don't then they're going to be up for a while""What about your sister?" Rob, coming back from his breakdown.James began to pace, "Did you see what she just did to Simon?""No I mean the other one"James perked up. Sara. He had forgotten about her, about to leave the house. "Maybe she coul-" with that the house began to rumble with a deepTHUMPTHUMPTHUMPFrom down the dark hallway a loud voice reverberated "James I'm leaving in 15, why the hell are they still awake?"."Speak of the devil, It's Sara." James ducked as she emerged from the darkness, a true giantess over them. If the baby was a hill and Marissa was mountain, Sara was a planet to them, twice the height of the table they stood on. Without hesitation she walked to the table just as Rob and Kelly ducked behind the potted plant James had taken residence in.Sara was a typical 18 year old, slightly short for her age but he was well endowed. She was very social and James had always seen her as defensive, as if she was always trying to hide her true motives. The group could help but marvel at the sheer size of the girl, her petite shoes themselves the size of a city block. Her towering legs lead up to a small skirt and dress. Clearly she was ready to go out. Her breasts casts shadows over them as they suspend somehow miraculously from thin spaghetti straps. Only now did James, Rob, and Kelly notice her face. She's furious."What the HELL, he just leaves like this? Is he joking?" She rambles into the void, doing her best to cope with the fact that she is no longer going out. She pulls out of her phone and punches in a number."Yeah, no, no, he's gone. Yeah I have to put them to bed, I know, I'm gonna kill him." As she hangs up her eyes dart to the plant for a fraction of a second. But then her gaze returns."Shit shit shit" Rob returns to panicking. She bends over to investigate the plant while James and Kelly try to remain particularly still. The billboard of a face just inches from their tiny forms. Her warm breath drifts over them as she looks for what she thinks she saw. Rob can't help himself, he's lost it. He begins waving and yelling."Down here! Sara! Down here!""Rob stop! Don't--" before James can stop him Sara quickly reaches over them and tips the plant. While the plant itself remains in place, a torrent of loose dirt joins them in free falling back to the surface of the table. The three sit motionless as the giant girl places her hand on its side and sweeps it towards them. Before any of them could stand the palm impacted them and dragged them across the table into her other hand, awaiting them off of the edge of the table. They landed on her giant hand, the ridges of her skin cushioning their fall. Without inspecting them she immediately begins walking, mumbling under her breath as she does."Damn bugs. He leaves AND tracks bugs into the house? Is he joking?"In her hand, the winds force James, Rob, and Kelly to hold on for dear life at the risk of falling to their certain death on the hardwood floor. Because of this life or death movement, none of them could see that she was walking to the bathroom.Without concern Sara dumped the bugs and dirt into the toilet. They crashed through the surface of the water, all three 'bugs' feeling extreme pain. To James it felt like landing on concrete, his entire body ached. Through the pain he saw his giant sister leaning over him, hand on the lever. The pain was too great to speak, so he silently prayed not to be flushed away in an instant to die in the flurry.Sara hesitated, staring down at the moving creatures. She was ready to kill them in the toilet, but as she dominated the small bugs she felt something arise within her. A smile crept across her face, she had an idea.For once today, some prayers were answered.Back to indexA Hard Place by S_P_RJames, Rob, and Kelly struggled to stay above the water line as their entire bodies ached. Part of James just wanted the entire ordeal to stop and given all the pain, he didn't even mind dying as long as it was quick. He would not be so lucky. From above Sara's hand returned to scoop all three of them into the air, once again hoisitng them while cupped in her giant hand. Her digits curled, plunging the them into total darkness only able to feel a distant heartbeat.Sara felt unusual. She had a boyfriend, who satisfied her just fine, but there was some part of standing tall over these bugs that made her feel so turned on. She scooped up the bugs and cupped her hand around them to assure they didn't tumble onto the floor. She made her way up the stairs and into her room, shutting and locking the door. Sure, the kids should be put to bed, but that could wait. This felt too good.After bouncing around the hand, the three sore teenagers suddenly felt the soft skin beneath them fall away. In a bright flash they found themselves skydiving through the air, but instead of certain death, they found a soft, pink colored surface meet them. As James recovered himself and made an attempt to guage the situation, he realized exacly where he was."Guys this is Saras room!""what the HELL is she doing?" Rob barked back, barely able to stand.The giant girl towered over them as she stood beside her bed, eclipsing the light and casting a long shadow over the group. James couldn't help but notice the unusual gaze she set upon them. Did she know it was them? Was she going to help?Sara had no intention of helping. She wactched the bugs tumble out of her hand and squirm on the bed. In her day-to-day life she was always the smaller one, but now, standing over these pathetic bugs, she felt empowered. She could do anything to these little things, they were all hers. Just the thought of what she was about to do brought her hand under her skirt, lightly rubbing herself. She bit her lip and plopped herself on her bed, creating an indent that launched the bugs an inch in the air and caused them to tumble toward her. With her keen eye, she picked one to begin with.James couldn't believe what he was seeing. His sister was getting off on this! She careened onto the bed launching him into the air and once again disorienting him as she contined to watch overhead. Her fingers then came swinging down from above, bringing the scent of her with them. Like a claw machine, they darted and snatched Rob from the bed, lifting him into the air without hesitation.Rob was terrified. What the hell was she doing? Can't she see it was a person? He thought to himself as her fingers clamped down on him, squeezing him to the brink of breaking his ribs. He felt the world spin as he was brought to her. She set him down between her outstretched thighs. The walls on both sides of him lead to the small curtain that was her skirt. She eyed him directly, not looking away for a second as she reveled in the moment.James was still a few feet away, watching as his sister stared down at Rob. Then, without warning, she lifted her ass off the bed, creating a tunnel arched by her skirt. She snatched Rob again, this time tossing him directly under her. She dropped herself unto him, smashing him between her panties and the rough bed. James was stunned as she began to masturbate using his friend.Sara was having a great time. She had no idea how good this could feel. The anticipation of it all, looking right down at this little bug that would be nothing in a couple minutes and then actually doing it. The bug mightve been small, but the waves of pleasure she felt as she ground her hips into the bed were immense.Rob was not having a great time. After the feeling of landing once again on Sara's comforter, he was without warning smashed into it, being ground against the giant girl and the rough fibers of the bed. The heat was unimaginable as her pussy reacted to the pure pleasure he was providing. The bed fibers were cutting deep into his skin, causing him to scream out in pain. His screams were to no avail as she continued, adding more and more weight as the rythmic feeling of him under her increased. At one point she stopped and lifted herself off of him, but only to stretch her panties to the side and continue, now allowing him to be smashed directly into her most senstitive area. He felt every bone slowly smashed to bits as he bled out beneath her. His screams entirely overshadowed by her moans, his last moments were a mix of feeling the pain of being ground into the fibers and feeling his exposed organs burned by her juices. Even after he was gone, she continued for a few more minutes, gaining the most pleasure possible from his demise.When is was all over Sara took a deep breath, her face blushed from the experience and her heart racing. She stood up from her bed and saw the stain. Deep read streaks all over the bed and herself. Shit, she thought, I'll clean it later. The kids needed her right now. Before she left, though, she scooped up the other bugs. "I can't forget about you two, now can I?" she said with a giggle, "Don't worry I'll save you for when Kyle gets here." She dumped James and Kelly into a large class jar on her desk and left the room.Back to indexJarred by S_P_RJames and Kelly tumbled awkwardly into the glass jar, landing with a thud on the cold glass that rimmed the bottom of the small container. James lay motionless in bruised pain as through a mental fog he saw his sisters distored form leave the room, presumably to put his other siblings to bed. Her departing words continued to echo in his head even after she left the room."Who is Kyle?" Kelly asked, almost reading his mind. She was already on her feet, standing over him."Her boyfriend. Kyle is her boyfriend." James said with dismay. If they had just shrunk he would be hopeful that Kyle could somehow see them and save them, but given what just happened to Rob, James knew his arrival would mean bad things for the both of them.Kelly was visibly dismayed, she didn't want to turn into some toy for the giant couple the way Rob was simply a toy for Sara."We have to get out of here" She suggested as she helped James to his feet. The two looked around for any method of escape, but the empty glass jar was massively tall for the two trapped within it. After pacing for a moment, James announced what they already knew."There's no way out Kelly"He sat on one side of the perfect circle of rimmed glass than lined the jar, while Kelly sat directly across from him, both staring into clear oblivion. James didn't even know Kelly that well. She was so damn quiet, he thought, plus she mainly knew Ron. It didn't help their relationship that Ron was now evenly divided between Sara's bedsheets and panties."How you feeling?" James opened. Making eye contact with Kelly from across the empty space."How am I feeling? How do you think?" Kelly replied, glaring at him."You know this isn't my fault, right?" James couldn't believe it. How was he the bad guy here? He'd been trying to save everyones lives."I know" Kelly mumbled, hugging her knees, almost in tears at their current prospects."Look" James said as he finally stood up "this is not the end of us, we're still people, she could still see us." He wasn't natually gifted at being comforting, but as he sat down next to her, he did his best. And over time they sat in silence, hearing the distant crying of Mary as she is put to bed. After the prolonged silence, James finally spoke:"How did you meet Rob?" He inquired. Launching her into a long story, then quickly developed into conversation betwen the two. For a few bug-sized people in a giant jar, James couldn't help but think that the conversation was good. For a few minutes their minds were completely absent from their situation and their future. But the future very quickly came to them.They heard the sound of a door opening and a male voice "Sara?" it asked aloud. James recognized it, it was Kyle. He and Kelly overheard them begin to speak, the voices becoming louder, and louder, until they were only on the other side of her door."Guess what I found" Sara announces as she creaked her door open and let Kyle in. Even distorted through the Jar, he was physically the Yin to Saras Yang. Even taller than either of them could believe. He bent over, peering unto them from above."You want to use them now?" He asked, his warm breath decending into the jar, making both James and Kelly gag."I don't see why not" She said as she smirked and brought Kyle in for a long kiss. As they made out, her hand decended to his pants, eyeing him seductively. Without hesitation, she used her other hand to pick up the jar. James and Kelly held onto one another for dear life. When Sara noticed that the bugs were together, she laughed."Aww check them out sweetie! Just like us!" She said as she rattled the jar around. James and Kelly, already beated and brused numorous times before, could not hold on as their bodies hit the hard class of the jar again, and again. Once it all settled down, the two lay at the bottom of the jar. Barely able to crane his head up, James watched helplessly as a massive hand reached in, and violently grabbed Kelly. She screamed, partially in pain from having her ribcage all but collapsed, and partly because she knew what happens next.Back to indexLoaded by S_P_RKelly was lifted slowly from the jar, her screams echoing through the small space. Her ribs were nearly shattered as the giant finger pads surrounded her form, the sharp nails nearly cutting her. The hand lifted her from the distored world of the glass jar and into a new view.Sara looked at her with an excited smile, like a kid at a candy store. Kelly could see that Sara's hand had already decended into Kyles pants while the other hand slowly craned the Kelly towards them. It slowly rotated as Sara brought Kelly between the lovers. Kelly found herself lying in an outstretched palm, looking up at two giant faces. Retreving her other hand from his pants, Sara pushed Kyle onto the awaiting bed, still stained from Saras recent session only an hour before."I have an idea" Sara announced as she slowly pulled down Kyles pants. "Hold the bug for a second" Sara laughed as she deposited Kelly onto the top of Kyles member.Kelly rolled onto it, barly able to prevent herself from falling onto the bed. The view was unbelievale, Kyle eyed her excitedly. She waved for his attention, but it was to no avail. He only saw her as a bug. Sara returned quickly, unwrapping something indistinguishable and tossing the shiny wrapper on the floor. It was a condom.Kelly once again screamed for her life as Sara carfully placed the condom around her and slid it onto Kyle. The speed at which this happened lead Kelly to be awkwardly pinned to the side of Kyles head, only her face staying in the air-filled top of the condom. The heat was brutal, Kelly was already sweating as the smell of Kyle permiated the space with anticipation. Though the thick rubber, Kelly watched as Sara sat on Kyles legs and began making out with him aggressively. His member was comforably between her legs as she lightly humped it.For Kelly, this was an agonizing process. Sara's jeans caught the condom and violently knocked and rotated it around. The smell of Kyle continued to emit as a small amount of precum filled the top of the condom. After a few moments, Sara finally got off, but only to remove her pants and underwear, leaving her naked in front of her boyfriend. Sara loved to taunt the bugs, she always felt a real sexual kick out of it. She teased Kyle as she got in position above him and spread her legs.Kelly continued to scream, much to Kyles please as he felt the bug squirming against him. Sara slowly decended, wagging her hips from side to side as she prepared to accept him. Finally, she reached him, slowly feeling his head enter her. Kelly immediatly felt the pressure, it slowly broke her and compacted her into a near liquid. She managed to stay alive, coughing up blood as her world entered darkness. Sara finally finished decending, she could feel the little squirms and she could not be more pleasured with the feeling. Like she had done before, she wagged her hips on Kyle, putting more pressure on the bug and eliciting more movement for her own pleasure.Then the act began. Sara slowly lifted herself and decended, then again, then quicker, and quicker. Kelly was in a living hell, the pressure made her ears pop as she tried to move and escape. She chocked on the thick layer of precum that threatened to drown her. It felt like eternity was passing and that it would never stop.For many minutes on end they went at it. Making out, feeling one another up, and especially for Sara, feeling the pleasure of destorying a living thing inside of her. Little did she know that it was actually another person. As Sara and Kyle began to reach climax, their sweat covered bodies sped up. Sara let out a moan and shook as she felt herself cum. Meanwhile Kyle was also about to cum, and on end of his member, the barely-alive Kelly could tell. She felt Sara tighten up and knew what was going to happen. In an instant the space around her head filled with thick cum and the pressure reached its peak, obliterating Kelly into pieces as she chocked on his cum.Sara and Kyle smiled as they breathed heavily. "That was great." Sara declared. She lifted herself off of him and began to get dressed."What do I do with this?" Kyle asked her as he peeled the loaded condom off of himself."Throw it out." She ordered. He dangled it over the trash can and watched as the semen covered bug bits collected on the end. He dropped it in.Back to indexAftermath by S_P_RKyle left soon after, with Sara passing out in her bed. This left James sitting in the jar, completely apathetic to the world around him. Kelly - the girl he had just befriended and actually learned to like - was now nothing but small pieces mixed with cum in a used condom, and of course parts of her were within Sara. She was still sleeping happily on her bed, completely satisfied with the life she just destroyed.James drifted out of sanity and consiousness all night. The constant reminder that every single one of his friends was gone persisted in his mind, including the despair of knowing he had no way out. He's pictured the whole group of them sitting around that weird metal thing that they'd found - what was that thing? Where did it go? None of that really mattered to James in this moment. Between falling in and out of sleep, he debated just smashing his head into the glass wall of the jar to end it now, rather than dying inside of his sister when she woke up and felt horny. Eventually, he passed out for most of the night, ready for what awaited him.He awoke to a room now filled with outside light. Within a few seconds he remembered everything that had happened and fell back into despair. Through the distorting glass of the jar he saw that Sara was gone - probably setting up breakfast for the others. It was only a matter of time until she returned.James was ready for death when the door creaked open, but instead of seeing his sister ready to abuse him he saw something entirely different. It was Mary. The giant baby toddled into Saras room. Even from above eye level, his giant baby sister still remained as intimidating as the night before. James remembered what she did with Becca. She looked around the room curiously, trying to find something to play with. And after just a moment, she eyed the jar.Great, he thought, I guess I'll die in a diaper.She hobbled over to the jar, James was afraid, but completely helpless as his sister reached up and grasped the top of the glass prison. But the baby was not coordinated, and she was only able to knock the jar off the table. James felt the world begin spinning as he felt his body smashed again and again against the tumbling glass walls. Then there was an enormous smash as the glass completely shattered. Giant shards of it tore through the air, but somehow James was not sliced by them. Instead, smalled flecks of glass gave him cuts on his arms, legs, and back. These caused him enourmous pain, but weren't fatal.He laid on the hard floor, barely able to get composed looking up at his sister. She was startled by the sound, as was Sara in the next room, who he heard yelling "what was that??"He started running for the door as the ground rumbled.Back to indexEnded by S_P_RJames felt the pain in his back and arms flare as he slid under the giant door, slightly ajar from Mary toddling through it moments before. As he got back on his feet, he could hear her crying behind him. She was probably startled. Least she's not covered in glass cuts, James thought to himself as he continually winced in pain.As he began to make his way down the massive corridor he saw Sara round the corner ahead, as he traced in eyes up her massive figure clad in only pajama shorts and a bra, he saw her face splashed with concern. She made several strides as she passed overhead. James dodged her foot as it smashed down onto the wood floor beside him. He kept running, this was after all a chance to get away from his deadly sisters. Behind him he heard Sara exclaim:"Oh my god what happened?"James recognized it would only be minutes until Mary calmed down and Sara would realize she was missing a bug. He rounded the corner and faced a new dilemma: The Stairs. James knew there was no other way, so he made the first of many leaps from the top onto the first stair, crashing and rolling in pain. He continued this over several minutes until he began to reach the bottom. Once again the ground began to rumble, this time Marissa was the obstacle. Her sock clad foot crashed down next to James on the stairs, knocking him off the side and subjecting him to a 10 story fall onto the hard tile below. He was momentarily knocked out.James awoke to distant female voices arguing. The pain was blistering and everywhere. Every cut on his body and every bone he'd broken in his most recent fall. As his vision began to transition from blurry to more or less clear, he saw a distant sparkle emerging from the kitchen. In an instant he realized what it was:The Metal Piece that started all of this.With full-body pain, he dragged himself toward it, actually making some progress as he crawled over the divide between the hallway and the kitchen. As if on queue, the rumbling returned. Only this time it wasn't one set of rumbling, it was two. James picked up his pace, half crawling half sliding toward the object, only a few human feet away now. It was sitting on the floor right in front of him.In this moment, dark shadow cast over James. Before he could react, a massive weight obliterated his legs, crunching them into a red paste. Thick, purple, rope like threads gripped the crushed remains and dragged them across the white tile, turning it a deep red. James screamed out in pain and rolled over. The object had been his 7 year old sisters foot, usually small but now giant and shielded by a sock stained with his blood. He looked up at the distant ceiling light beaming down unto him.Closer to him, three faces looked down. His three sisters. Sara held Mary in her arms while Marissa retracted her foot away."Aww, I missed it." She announced as he bent over to get a better view of the bug. She grimaced. "It's really big and gross"Mary giggled aloud at the sight. Kicking her legs as if she wanted to finish the bug off.Sara would never admit it but she was loving this. She instictually felt one of her hands drift down between her legs, slightly massaging her pajama bottoms. "Hey Marissa, Finish it off, but slowly"Marrissa lifted her foot, happy to oblige.Below, James had rolled back over, well aware of his fate. He couldn't help but look at the object right in front of him. He painfully dragged himself toward it, blood spilling from him as he writhed in pain. He felt the familiar shadow again overtake him as he readied himself to be finished off. Instead the foot stopped decending right above him, the smell wafting down and paralyzing James. The bitter salt entered his mouth and eyes, burning them as he began to scream to no avail. Then Marissa began to lower her foot.The wall of dirty thread decended, pinning James under it and slowly grinding him into the tile. He screamed with all he had, knowing there was no escape as he felt his bones shatter and compact under it. The pressure was unbearable as he felt himself liquify and be absorbed into the socked foot. The pain unlike anything he had felt before, and then: Nothing.Marrissa removed he foot, satisfied. "Got it" and went to get a paper towel.Sara smiled and blushed, "yes you did."
